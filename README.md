# Multiroom Communication System
By Shehriar Burney, Rimsha Rizvi, and Avi Bhatnagar

We aimed to develop a wireless communication system using three Arduinos to transmit and receive environmental data and emergency codes with sender identification. The system operates in environments where real-time monitoring of temperature and light is essential, particularly in farming. It utilizes temperature and light sensors and a potentiometer to map emergency codes. The system uses other various components, including LCD displays, LEDs, and RF transmitters/receivers, ensuring accountability for each transmission. The system provides a reliable way to monitor environmental factors and respond to emergencies promptly, making it suitable for use in diverse settings, including farming.
